# myIdeasAndThoughts

All your hate and distress, comes from within, it is You who are <b>CAUSING</b> them, because you think you are incapable of achieving the same level as the others

## So <b>STOP</b>  blaming yourself and accept who you are

After all, the only one you can rely on, and with you to the end, is yourself
Others are still others, you are not them, you are yourself, accept who you are, and what you can acheive
### Make peace with you, your inner self. That is what really matters
